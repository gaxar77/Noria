# Noria

Note: This code became inoperative in one feature for some reason unknown to me, and, although I endeavored to find the bug, I failed.

This is a file manager application, having only the most basic features, many of which are not yet implemented.
I intend to grow it into a large application like the Windows File Explorer.

The name of this application will change to avoid conflicts with an existing company name.

## Features
1. Displays a tree of folders for each of the drives on the computer, where each folder item can be expanded and collapsed.
2. Displays files and folder in a detailed data grid, showing the file name, modified date, type, and size.
3. Displays an interface allowing the user to navigate from folder to folder by double-clicking on the folder in the folder view, clicking open after selecting a folder in the folder view, selecting a folder in the folder tree view, clicking a breadcrumb button, typing a folder path into the path bar and pressing enter, clicking back, forth, or up. 
4. Allows the user to open, rename, and delete files and folders by clicking on the respective button after selecting a file/folder.
5. Has a partially implemented breadcrumb that turns into a folder path textbox when you click on an area besides the buttons. The breadcrum displays the folder path, where each component of the path is a separate button. When you click on a breadcrumb button, Noria navigates to that folder.
6. Allows the user to create new files and folders (But does not yet allow the user to create new files from a template or wizard.)
7. Updates the folder view and folder tree view in response to file system changes

## Features shown in the interface but not yet implemented.
1. Will allow the user to copy, cut, and past files/folders.
2. Will allow the user to view the properties of a file/folder.

## Screenshots

Below is a screenshot of the current interface. I know it's not very pleasing asthetically, but I intend to improve its appearance in the future.
